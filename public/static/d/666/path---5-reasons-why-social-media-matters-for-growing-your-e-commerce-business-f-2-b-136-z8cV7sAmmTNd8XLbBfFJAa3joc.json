You might even be wondering why it matters if you learn how to tweet, post on Instagram, run a Facebook account, or manage a Google Business page. Trust us, it does.</p>\n<p id=\"ed58\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu pd hw pe pf pg ph pi pj pk ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">If you’re not fluent in the social media craze, don’t fret.

In a way, social media helps you tackle all three of those niches — and more — in a powerful, modern way.</p>\n<p id=\"d89a\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu pd hw pe pf pg ph pi pj pk ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Read on to learn why we think social media matters when it comes to growing your e-commerce business!</p>\n<h4 id=\"70a4\" class=\"gq gr cf bd bc ds ud ue uf ug uh ui uj uk ul um gu\">How Can Social Media Grow Your E-Commerce Business?</h4>\n<p id=\"6617\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu qb hw qc pf qd ph qe pj qf ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">No matter what size business you’re running — from a tiny e-commerce shop to an enormous company — you need a social media presence if you want your e-commerce shop to thrive.</p>\n<p id=\"2987\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu pd hw pe pf pg ph pi pj pk ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><mark class=\"uq up tm\">Social media helps your business grow in so many ways — from simply connecting better with your customers to boosting your conversion rates.</mark>Being social media savvy can instrumentally increase the traffic to your shop, become an inexpensive marketing tool, provide authority for your brand, and — perhaps best of all — help you understand how better to run your business.</p>\n<h5 id=\"4a52\" class=\"pp gr cf bd bc ds pq pr ps pt pu pv pw px py pz qa\"><strong class=\"bq\">1. Improves Your Brand Recognition</strong></h5>\n<p id=\"3c03\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu qb hw qc pf qd ph qe pj qf ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Few things are more important for a company’s brand than recognition and awareness. Why? Because being able to set yourself apart and create a recognizable brand is what’s going to differentiate you from your competitors in your industry.</p>\n<p id=\"69e0\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu pd hw pe pf pg ph pi pj pk ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><mark class=\"uq up tm\">If your brand is noticeable, memorable, and recognizable, you’re driving consumer decisions, encouraging repeat purchases, and creating an awareness about your brand that will diminish your competitors.</mark></p>\n<p id=\"cc83\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu pd hw pe pf pg ph pi pj pk ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Social media is a huge tool for<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong class=\"ht if\"> </strong><a class=\"bk cv pl pm pn po\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307556250_The_Effect_of_Social_Media_to_the_Brand_Awareness_of_A_Product_of_A_Company\"><strong class=\"ht if\">brand recognition</strong></a>.</span> With it, you’re creating platforms to spread your messages, disseminate your brand’s aesthetics and ethics, and channel your voice by creating and sharing helpful, informative, and branded content.</p>\n<p id=\"254c\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu pd hw pe pf pg ph pi pj pk ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">With this, you’re doing a few things at once. You’re opening your brand up to a new market, with a new audience. You’re creating a platform that’s entirely about channeling your voice, and you’re making it easier for your customers to create a dialogue with you.</p>\n<p id=\"c358\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu pd hw pe pf pg ph pi pj pk ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">In the end, this can create powerful brand recognition, as well as brand loyalty, a powerful tool for a business.</p>\n<h5 id=\"3841\" class=\"pp gr cf bd bc ds pq pr ps pt pu pv pw px py pz qa\"><strong class=\"bq\">2. Acts as a Useful Conversion Tool</strong></h5>\n<p id=\"2b7c\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu qb hw qc pf qd ph qe pj qf ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">At its core, social media might just seem like pretty pictures and branded content, but it’s so much more than that.</p>\n<p id=\"cb18\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu pd hw pe pf pg ph pi pj pk ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><mark class=\"uq up tm\">An exceptional social media strategy and marketing plan can become an easy, intuitive way to create more opportunities for conversion as well as driving higher conversion rates for your e-commerce business.</mark></p>\n<p id=\"7b20\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu pd hw pe pf pg ph pi pj pk ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">With social media, your goal is building up a following of people — customers or not — who you can connect with, share with, and interact with. Through this, you’re able to increase your conversions — the more interactions with followers, the higher the chance they’ll click through to your site, browse, and purchase from you.</p>\n<p id=\"1b56\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu pd hw pe pf pg ph pi pj pk ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">No, you can’t guarantee that every single comment, like, or share from your social media platform will ensure that you get a conversion or make a sale.

However, no matter how famous and known Marvel is, they never slack on their social media channels or campaigns. Marvel utilized social media to help make buying tickets to their movies easier. How? They took a look at how to eliminate the step-by-step process of “see a cool post about a movie, follow the bio link to the website where you can see movie times, follow a new link where you can purchase tickets” and so on. The conversation rates were suffering because of how many steps it took.</p>\n<p id=\"f6fe\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu pd hw pe pf pg ph pi pj pk ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">So, they utilized social media tools like the “swipe up story” feature to make the process simpler. Once a user swiped up on their social media, they could buy a ticket in under a minute without leaving the app. The result? A 68 percent increase in their social media conversion rates.</p>\n<p id=\"6620\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu pd hw pe pf pg ph pi pj pk ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Another great thing about social media for e-commerce conversions? It helps to give your brand a voice. You’re no longer just a brand name without a personality. You’re humanized, making it easier for people to trust you and purchase from you.</p>\n<h5 id=\"1d31\" class=\"pp gr cf bd bc ds pq pr ps pt pu pv pw px py pz qa\">3. Creates Your Brand’s Authority</h5>\n<p id=\"916a\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu qb hw qc pf qd ph qe pj qf ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Typically, the more followers a brand has on social media and the more established they are on social media, the more an audience will trust you.</p>\n<p id=\"faef\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu pd hw pe pf pg ph pi pj pk ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Often, a company’s goal is establishing its brand as the most authoritative voice within their industry. <mark class=\"uq up tm\">Social media and a strong online presence are two of the biggest ways to position your brand as the expert within your industry.</mark></p>\n<p id=\"2ec7\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu pd hw pe pf pg ph pi pj pk ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Why? Because people buy from the brands they trust — they buy from the experts.</p>\n<p id=\"b75c\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu pd hw pe pf pg ph pi pj pk ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">To put it simply, if people trust your brand and view you as the expert within your industry, your conversion rates are likely to increase.

Draws in New Visitors</h5>\n<p id=\"f329\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu qb hw qc pf qd ph qe pj qf ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Think of every social media platform as an opportunity for an entirely new audience to discover your brand. If you’re relying solely on your website, you’re limited — no matter how finely tuned your SEO strategy is for that site.</p>\n<p id=\"4f60\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu pd hw pe pf pg ph pi pj pk ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><mark class=\"uq up tm\">With every new social media avenue, you’re granting your brand the opportunity to be viewed by millions of new customers — whether they’re searching for a brand like yours or not.</mark> Further, the more quality content you put out, and the more followers you gain because of it, the better your visibility will become.</p>\n<p id=\"0a52\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu pd hw pe pf pg ph pi pj pk ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Investing time and effort into a solid social media strategy can help boost your viewers immensely!</p>\n<h5 id=\"5be3\" class=\"pp gr cf bd bc ds pq pr ps pt pu pv pw px py pz qa\">5. Improves Your SEO (Significantly)</h5>\n<p id=\"6110\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu qb hw qc pf qd ph qe pj qf ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Because you’re an online business, you’ve certainly heard the term SEO before. In fact, if it’s not a vital part of your online strategy for your e-commerce business, you’re missing out on some key information.</p>\n<p id=\"16de\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu pd hw pe pf pg ph pi pj pk ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">SEO — put in its simplest terms — is the measurement of how your business ranks within specific search engines. Obviously, the higher up you’re listed in a search result, the better your choices of driving traffic to your site.</p>\n<p id=\"315c\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu pd hw pe pf pg ph pi pj pk ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Although SEO is ever-evolving and the practices constantly are being refined, there’s one thing that hasn’t changed in a while. Search engines such as Google, are combing through social media platforms and using that presence as a way to rank your business.</p>\n<p id=\"5b66\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu pd hw pe pf pg ph pi pj pk ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">For that<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong class=\"ht if\"> </strong><a class=\"bk cv pl pm pn po\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/social-media-seo/196185/\"><strong class=\"ht if\">reason</strong></a> </span>alone, being active on social media is a must for online brands.

By investing in social media — with time, effort, and resource allocation — you’re investing in your brand’s future. Because it’s ever-changing, it’s important to get on the social media train now. When you do, you’ll likely find creative ways to better your brand, improve your conversions, and market to your audience.</p>\n<p id=\"6006\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu pd hw pe pf pg ph pi pj pk ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">If you’re interested in learning more about how our service can improve your inventory management control,<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"> <a class=\"bk cv pl pm pn po\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://fetchr.us/Business\"><strong class=\"ht if\">get in touch</strong></a>.</span> Or read more advice on <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a class=\"bk cv pl pm pn po\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"http://bit.ly/ecommerceinUAE\"><strong class=\"ht if\">how to start an eCommerce business.</strong></a></span></p>\n</div>\n</section>\n<hr class=\"qg fu nb qh kv ku qi qj qk ql qm\" />\n<section class=\"gg gh gi gj gk\">\n<div class=\"r oe p q l m\">\n<p id=\"46d5\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu pd hw pe pf pg ph pi pj pk ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><em class=\"qn\">We are Fetchr; a company specialized in e-fulfillment.
