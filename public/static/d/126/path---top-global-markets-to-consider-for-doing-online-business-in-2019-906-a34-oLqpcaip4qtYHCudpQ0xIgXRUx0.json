What’s more, by 2021, online sales are expected to reach nearly $4.5 trillion — doubling the total in less than five years. But you don’t need our global markets insight to tell you there’s huge potential in the e-commerce market, because that’s why you’re here.</p>\n<p id=\"1726\" class=\"jv jw bm bc jx b jy jz ka kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ki\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">But with the entire world a few clicks away, it can be difficult as an e-commerce business entrepreneur to figure out the markets you want to target. More often than not, we tend to start at home, where it’s familiar. Luckily for us here in the Middle East, there is a lot of growth happening that’s great for e-commerce business owners such as yourself.</p>\n<p id=\"3052\" class=\"jv jw bm bc jx b jy jz ka kb kc kd ke kf kg kh ki\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">In this piece, we’re going to take a look at the biggest e-commerce markets on the planet right now, as well as the markets that quickly are gaining speed — some of them right in our own backyards.

But compared to the e-commerce markets above, Indonesia’s $7.2 billion e-commerce market might seem small. What needs to be accounted for, though, is their huge growth rate of 78% year over year — making it the fastest growing e-commerce market on the planet.</li>\n<li id=\"b47d\" class=\"jv jw bm bc jx b jy kr ka ks kc kt ke ku kg kv ki ko kp kq\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">\n<h5><strong class=\"jx kn\">Mexico 59%</strong></h5>\n<p>Bordering the United States, as well as greatly investing in and improving their logistics, has paid off tremendously for Mexico. Their e-commerce market is growing at a whopping 59% every year, and that’s in one already worth $16.2 billion.</li>\n<li id=\"0fef\" class=\"jv jw bm bc jx b jy kr ka ks kc kt ke ku kg kv ki ko kp kq\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">\n<h5><strong class=\"jx kn\">The Philippines 51%</strong></h5>\n<p>Granted, the e-commerce market in the Philippines is worth just $1.6 billion. But, there’s huge potential here, with its e-commerce market growing at 51% annually. At the moment, the Philippines is battling old consumer habits, such as wanting to pay with “cash upon delivery” rather than digitally. However, as its e-commerce market develops, we think customers will evolve too</li>\n<li id=\"871e\" class=\"jv jw bm bc jx b jy kr ka ks kc kt ke ku kg kv ki ko kp kq\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">\n<h5><strong class=\"jx kn\">Colombia 45%</strong></h5>\n<p>Colombia might have an e-commerce market that’s worth a smaller $5.2 billion, but you can’t deny how quickly the market is growing. Consumers there are turning to e-commerce for convenience and the ability to compare prices. And a great delivery network only is helping its e-commerce market develop further.</li>\n<li id=\"c854\" class=\"jv jw bm bc jx b jy kr ka ks kc kt ke ku kg kv ki ko kp kq\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">\n<h5><strong class=\"jx kn\">UAE 33%</strong></h5>\n<p>While the United Arab Emirates has a small population of just 9 million, it has a relatively large and impressive e-commerce market of $5.1 billion that’s growing by a third year over year. As one of the richest nations in the world, and with consumer spending totaling more than $200 billion a year, getting a good footing in the UAE could prove to be quite lucrative.</li>\n<li id=\"ea19\" class=\"jv jw bm bc jx b jy kr ka ks kc kt ke ku kg kv ki ko kp kq\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">\n<h5><strong class=\"jx kn\">Vietnam 32%</strong></h5>\n<p>This otherwise tiny Asian country is just one of the many China-neighboring nations that is benefiting from that behemoth’s e-commerce success. The country’s e-commerce market is worth only $2.6 billion, but with yearly growth of 32%, you can’t deny its rising status.</li>\n<li id=\"003a\" class=\"jv jw bm bc jx b jy kr ka ks kc kt ke ku kg kv ki ko kp kq\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">\n<h5><strong class=\"jx kn\">Saudi Arabia 32%</strong></h5>\n<p>While it’s well known the Saudi economy relies heavily on oil, the country has been working to diversify it, both for residents and consumers. Today, their e-commerce market is worth around $4.5 billion, with a lot of room for growth. The market has increased by 32 percent year over year.</li>\n<li id=\"d434\" class=\"jv jw bm bc jx b jy kr ka ks kc kt ke ku kg kv ki ko kp kq\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">\n<h5><strong class=\"jx kn\">India 27% </strong></h5>\n<p>While India might be at the bottom of this list, with 27% yearly growth (which is still substantial), it’s their projected growth of $84 billion by 2021 that shows this market’s real potential. Internet is cheap and widely available there, making it a great place to get your footing as an e-commerce business.</li>\n<li id=\"f8ee\" class=\"jv jw bm bc jx b jy kr ka ks kc kt ke ku kg kv ki ko kp kq\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">\n<h5><strong class=\"jx kn\">China 27%</strong></h5>\n<p>The e-commerce market in China isn’t just huge, it’s growing quickly too.
