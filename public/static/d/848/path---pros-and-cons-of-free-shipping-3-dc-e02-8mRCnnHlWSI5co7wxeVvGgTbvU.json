Souq is among the most prominent e-commerce platforms in the Middle East. (Source: Istizada)</strong></h6>\n<p>Free shipping significantly affects your appeal in the eyes of an indecisive shopper. This is particularly important in the Middle East, where the last mile delivery is one of the greatest challenges in the e-commerce sector.</p>\n<p>Offering free shipping to the customer’s doorstep is a great way to get ahead while the Middle Eastern online shopping sector is still in its early growth phase.</p>\n<h4>Cons of Free Shipping</h4>\n<h5>1. Difficult to Calculate Profit</h5>\n<p>While free delivery is a great trick to increase your sales and customer retention, this does not necessarily lead to increased revenue or profit.</p>\n<p>Product delivery charges depend on a wide range of factors, including the type of item, its size and weight, and the customer’s location. This means that shipping costs can vary greatly, and in some cases even surpass the price of the product.</p>\n<p>The decision to offer free delivery should not be made lightly. There are several ways to make free shipping profitable for your business.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Run split tests and compare conversion with and without a free delivery offer.</li>\n<li>Establish the minimum order value required for free shipping, and test the improvement in margin.</li>\n<li>Set restrictions by offering free shipping only on select products                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Free shipping also should come with a carefully crafted return policy. Serial returners can take advantage of free returns and essentially transform your product into a freebie (for them).</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>2. Slow delivery</h5>\n<p>Express delivery usually is not viable for sellers with a free shipping policy. If you offer standard delivery and your customer across the world really needs that dress in two days — you are in for a very dissatisfied customer who won’t buy from you again.</p>\n<p>This is why it should be advertised and explained honestly. For example, you can offer free delivery on standard shipping. In the checkout box, you can inform buyers about the delivery time and charges for express shipping.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion</h4>\n<p>In general, free shipping is a good business practice that will allow your business to increase sales and build a brand. However, it comes with a serious set of considerations that apply to each business individually.</p>\n<p>It is a good choice for businesses selling small and light products that do not require special shipping methods. Larger, more robust, and sensitive items, however, incur significant product delivery charges. That is an undertaking that is profitable only for e-commerce industry giants such as Amazon and eBay.</p>\n<p>Another solution for small and mid-size businesses that want to offer free shipping and remain profitable is a partnership with a trustworthy, dedicated logistics company.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>We are Fetchr; a company specialized in e-fulfillment.
