Excellent customer service is more than just a means to an end, it’s a business tool. How you handle your customer service says everything about your brand, your products, and your business.</p>\n<p id=\"94cf\" class=\"lh li ck ba lj b lk ll lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">So, if customer service is truly that exceptionally powerful (HINT: it is), it only makes sense that you’d want to do everything in your power to ensure that you’re providing your customers with the exceptional, miles-ahead-of-the-competitors type of service. In other words, you’re looking for the WOW factor.</p>\n<p id=\"1596\" class=\"lh li ck ba lj b lk ll lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">How do you get there, you ask? Check out a few of our top tips for creating WOW-worthy customer service strategies.</p>\n<h4 id=\"dcdc\" class=\"lv lw ck ba az do lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh\">Make Your Service Personalized</h4>\n<p id=\"9ab4\" class=\"lh li ck ba lj b lk mi lm mj lo mk lq ml ls mm lu\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">If you want to make your customers <em class=\"mn\">feel </em>valued and help them understand their worth, you have to invest in them. That means no more generic customer service emails, no more blanket responses. <a class=\"bh da mo mp mq mr\" href=\"http://redcarpetlearning.com/create-customer-delight-5-ways-add-wow-factor-service-experience/\"><strong class=\"lj ms\">Per<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">s</span>onalized customer service</strong></a> is what’s going to take your service a step above.</p>\n<p id=\"577d\" class=\"lh li ck ba lj b lk ll lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Treat your customers like you’d wanted to be treated — really, really well. Get to know them. Do your best to solve their problems. Don’t just write them off as another number. Personalized customer service goes above and beyond prompt, ingenuine responses.</p>\n<h4 id=\"569a\" class=\"lv lw ck ba az do lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh\">Be Proactive in Your Service</h4>\n<p id=\"8f66\" class=\"lh li ck ba lj b lk mi lm mj lo mk lq ml ls mm lu\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Don’t just be reactive with your customer service, be proactive. Anticipate problems. Realize potential issues.<a class=\"bh da mo mp mq mr\" href=\"http://redcarpetlearning.com/create-customer-delight-5-ways-add-wow-factor-service-experience/\"><strong class=\"lj ms\"> Anticipate both wants and needs</strong></a>. Be several steps ahead of your customers to help them solve problems before they even happen. For example, send check-up emails. You don’t have to check in every single week, just reach out every so often to let your clients know you care and you have their back.</p>\n<h4 id=\"350e\" class=\"lv lw ck ba az do lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh\">Make it Easy for Customers to Contact You</h4>\n<p id=\"373b\" class=\"lh li ck ba lj b lk mi lm mj lo mk lq ml ls mm lu\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">One of the biggest pieces of great customer service is making it easy for your clients to know how to contact you. If you send your customers on a wild goose chase across your website looking for your contact email or phone number, the odds are (when they do eventually figure it out), they’re already going to be agitated. Make sure you have your customer service contact info loud and proud on your site, sharing space with all of your deliverables, and in easy-to-Google areas.</p>\n<h4 id=\"f614\" class=\"lv lw ck ba az do lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh\">Provide the Right Tools for Your Customer Service Team</h4>\n<p id=\"19ab\" class=\"lh li ck ba lj b lk mi lm mj lo mk lq ml ls mm lu\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Whether your customer service team is 100 employees strong, or it’s just you answering a phone, make sure your department is<a class=\"bh da mo mp mq mr\" href=\"https://acquire.io/blog/customer-service-tips/\"><strong class=\"lj ms\"> properly <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">equipped</span> with the tools people need to solve problems</strong>.</a> It’s not enough just to have someone available and ready to answer calls. They need to be free to actually remedy situations. Giving your team access to tools that let them screenshare with customers and live chat with them, and even providing software programs to help enhance the customer experience is setting them up for success. Of course, having a great customer service team sets you up for success, too!</p>\n<h4 id=\"3e32\" class=\"lv lw ck ba az do lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh\">Under Promise &amp; Over Deliver</h4>\n<p id=\"1607\" class=\"lh li ck ba lj b lk mi lm mj lo mk lq ml ls mm lu\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Make your ordinary actions extraordinary! We don’t mean that you should promise your clients terrible service (never do that!), but we do know that customers are always mega-impressed when you surpass their expectations. Do your best to go above and beyond to make their entire experience comfortable and pleasant. Then take it a step further.</p>\n<h4 id=\"2f39\" class=\"lv lw ck ba az do lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh\">Be Direct, Honest, and Attentive</h4>\n<p id=\"8021\" class=\"lh li ck ba lj b lk mi lm mj lo mk lq ml ls mm lu\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">It’s important to remember that your customers are the reason you’re in business. As an e-commerce owner who doesn’t always do business with people face-to-face, forgetting that fact can be devastating. That’s why it’s vital to recognize that your customers are <strong class=\"lj ms\">your</strong> <strong class=\"lj ms\">why for getting into your business. </strong>With that in mind, make sure you’re treating them with that respect. Your customers are people — they’re fair and essentially good. If you take the time to be honest, direct, and attentive, they’ll return the favor. Talk to your customers in a straightforward way. Really boil down the problem, and then do everything you can to fix it.</p>\n<h4 id=\"b26b\" class=\"lv lw ck ba az do lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh\">Be Courteous &amp; Positive</h4>\n<p id=\"25f5\" class=\"lh li ck ba lj b lk mi lm mj lo mk lq ml ls mm lu\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">You can do everything imaginable to equip your team with the customer service technology and tools they need. But if you’re not demanding courteous, positive attitudes as part of your customer service standards,<a class=\"bh da mo mp mq mr\" href=\"https://www.helpscout.com/helpu/customer-service-tips/\"><strong class=\"lj ms\">you’re not likely going to be a fan of your results</strong></a>. Language and attitude are everything — especially when dealing with a disgruntled or displeased customer. Some business owners believe that if a customer is complaining to customer service, they’ve lost both the sale and the client, but that’s not the case. Courteous, positive customer service representatives can both save that sale and that client <strong class=\"lj ms\">and </strong>create new opportunities for conversion. It’s all about patience, courtesy, and positivity.</p>\n<h4 id=\"9188\" class=\"lv lw ck ba az do lx ly lz ma mb mc md me mf mg mh\">Strategically Use Automation</h4>\n<p id=\"af00\" class=\"lh li ck ba lj b lk mi lm mj lo mk lq ml ls mm lu\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">There’s a delicate balance between keeping your customer service standards high and your response times low. That’s where automated customer service tools (such as chatbots!) can come in handy. While we don’t recommend you let automated responses dictate your entire customer service workflow, we do think it’s vital to craft personalized, custom messages that can be sent to your customers ASAP. That way, they know you’re on the ball.</p>\n<p id=\"f7e2\" class=\"lh li ck ba lj b lk ll lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">When it comes to running an e-commerce business, customer service is everything! Take a good, hard look at your customer service. Is it dynamic enough for your customers? Remember, customer service<a class=\"bh da mo mp mq mr\" href=\"https://www.helpscout.com/helpu/customer-service-tips/\"> <strong class=\"lj ms\">isn’t <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">just</span> a means to an end</strong></a> — it’s about building relationships and a reputation for yourself.</p>\n</div>\n</section>\n<hr class=\"mt gf ij cb mu ir mv mw mx my mz\" />\n<section class=\"el em jv jw jx\">\n<div class=\"w jy v fx fv fw\">\n<p id=\"9f6d\" class=\"lh li ck ba lj b lk ll lm ln lo lp lq lr ls lt lu\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><em class=\"mn\">We are Fetchr; a company specialized in e-fulfillment.
