In fact, there are dozens of ways that you, an e-commerce entrepreneur, can affordably and effectively market your store to your customers in your competitive market.</p>\n<h4 id=\"d794\" class=\"iv iw cn bd ix b iy on ja oo op oq or os ot ou ji\">Here are a few tips to consider:</h4>\n<h5 id=\"a7b4\" class=\"iv iw cn bd ix b iy on ja oo op oq or os ot ou ji\"><strong class=\"ix jj\">Focus on your product’s value</strong></h5>\n<p id=\"1484\" class=\"iv iw cn bd ix b iy on ja oo op oq or os ot ou ji\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Your customers are going to consider dozens of factors before buying a product, but the factor they care most about is &#8220;<strong class=\"ix jj\">What’s in it for them?’ </strong>That’s where marketing effectively and with purpose comes into play. If you’re able to focus your marketing tactics on the value your products can provide your customers, you’ve already won half the battle.</p>\n<p class=\"iv iw cn bd ix b iy on ja oo op oq or os ot ou ji\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Every marketing tactic — every step of the way — should be about how you and your product are going to better your customers’ lives — how you’ll change the way they look at the world. Not only does this type of value lead to sales, but it leads to your customers sharing your value with other potential customers too. This is a cheap, easy way to promote and market your business.</p>\n<h5 id=\"ccdb\" class=\"gk gl cn bd bc ea ow ox oy oz pa pb pc pd pe pf go\">Use several formats to reach your market</h5>\n<p id=\"2f4b\" class=\"iv iw cn bd ix b iy pg ja ph op pi or pj ot pk ji\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Our best advice? Stop limiting yourself. It’s not enough just to market yourself on your own e-commerce shop — you need to come at your customers on a variety of online platforms to get their attention. First things first — figure out your target market. Once you do that, figure out where that target market congregates online. Is it Facebook? Is it Twitter? Instagram? LinkedIn? Once you’re able to zero in on that detail, you can better repurpose your marketing content to appeal to these unique formats. The entire goal is reaching people — as an online business, a good majority of that likely will be online.</p>\n<p id=\"5b18\" class=\"iv iw cn bd ix b iy on ja oo op oq or os ot ou ji\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The point is, use every format at your disposal to target your market and show off your brand. Relying on one platform simply won’t work in this day and age.</p>\n<h5 id=\"255c\" class=\"gk gl cn bd bc ea ow ox oy oz pa pb pc pd pe pf go\">Create quality content</h5>\n<p id=\"786c\" class=\"iv iw cn bd ix b iy pg ja ph op pi or pj ot pk ji\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">About 92 percent of content marketers believe that blog content is an asset to their success — that says something. People aren’t just looking for a great product, they’re looking for great information, great knowledge, and a great resource — producing quality content for your audience gifts them all that and more.</p>\n<p class=\"iv iw cn bd ix b iy pg ja ph op pi or pj ot pk ji\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Consider starting a blog, a YouTube channel, or an Instagram page that focuses on providing your visitors with the quality content they crave.</p>\n<h5 id=\"4240\" class=\"gk gl cn bd bc ea ow ox oy oz pa pb pc pd pe pf go\">Collaborate with influencers</h5>\n<p id=\"e29a\" class=\"iv iw cn bd ix b iy pg ja ph op pi or pj ot pk ji\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Undoubtedly, in our modern, social media era, you’ve heard the term influencer before. While that’s a relatively loaded phrase, at its most basic definition, an influencer is a public figure (likely on social media) who has access to a large audience.</p>\n<p class=\"iv iw cn bd ix b iy pg ja ph op pi or pj ot pk ji\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Oftentimes, that large audience cares about what that influencer has to say, what products they use, and what they’re interested in.</p>\n<p class=\"iv iw cn bd ix b iy pg ja ph op pi or pj ot pk ji\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Partnering with social media influencers is a powerful way for your brand, business, and products to gain traction online — in essence, it’s an entirely unique, and modern, way to gain access to your target customers.</p>\n<p id=\"75f4\" class=\"iv iw cn bd ix b iy on ja oo op oq or os ot ou ji\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">These influencers should be people with high reach, who can influence your potential buyers. For example, if you were a makeup brand, you’d likely try working with a popular makeup artist and collaborate with them on YouTube to reach their audience with your products.</p>\n<p id=\"1746\" class=\"iv iw cn bd ix b iy on ja oo op oq or os ot ou ji\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The best advice we can offer here is don’t approach influencers inappropriately. If you feel your products genuinely could benefit them, reach out — if you honestly think they won’t, find someone else who could. Once you find an adequate social media influencer, work with them, include them in your brand’s marketing, and listen to what they have to say about your product. Through them, you’ll be able to reach an entirely new audience.</p>\n<p id=\"5647\" class=\"iv iw cn bd ix b iy on ja oo op oq or os ot ou ji\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">These tips undoubtedly will make the  e-commerce shop get noticed. Remember, it’s not enough to just be online — you need to brainstorm creative ways to garner attention for your business, brand, and products! As your brand gets noticed, you’ll likely convert those visitors into buyers! Now that you have those buyers, what’s next? Keeping them happy, of course. But that’s not always easy.
