Do you know exactly what you’ll sell, what your brand will be, and how you’ll meet customers’ needs?

In fact, most users are spending <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a class=\"bk cv pl pm pn po\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.bluecorona.com/blog/mobile-marketing-statistics\">about five hours daily on their smartphones and devices,</a></span> and about 70 percent of web traffic happens on a mobile device.</p>\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1154 size-full\" src=\"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/static.fetchr.us/stage/1_Hz7sHEUriIHaKx5MlUztUg.jpeg\" alt=\"statistics indicating what would happen if consumers stopped using smartphones\" width=\"560\" height=\"215\" /></p>\n<h6 style=\"text-align: left;\">Source: Mobile Usage Stats by BCG</h6>\n<p id=\"434e\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">What’s that mean for your website? It should be built with mobile in mind! Your online shop should have a responsive design template that’s accessible for users at any time from any place — desktop or iPhone.</p>\n<p id=\"6911\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Much of this has to do with the concept of immediacy — when consumers see something they like from an online shop, they don’t want to wait. They want to purchase ASAP. Providing them with the means to do so will undoubtedly boost your sales while also providing them with a better, faster, and more pleasant user experience.</p>\n<p id=\"030a\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">In short, <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a class=\"ci ce ks kt ku kv\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.theceomagazine.com/business/innovation-technology/3-reasons-why-your-site-must-be-mobile-friendly/%20which%20states:\">accessible websites are the key to creating the ultimate customer experience.</a></span></p>\n<h4 id=\"87f4\" class=\"ka kb bm bc bb fy kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km\">Advanced Navigation &amp; Search Functions</h4>\n<p id=\"b5d8\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp kn jr ko jt kp jv kq jx kr jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Think about your online shop for a moment. Do you consider it to be user-friendly? If you’re looking for something specific on your site, how easily (and how quickly) can you find it? If you’re scratching your head and are unsure of the answers to these questions, it’s likely your navigation and search functions <strong class=\"jo lc\">aren’t functional enough.</strong></p>\n<p id=\"9c95\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Your site’s navigation and search functions are two of the most vital keys to your website.

Consider the functionality of your navigation. Is there a good flow to your tools? Neither of these functions should be hidden or difficult to use — they should be in plain sight and entirely functional.</p>\n<p id=\"14e4\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Have you ever <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a class=\"ci ce ks kt ku kv\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.fashionnova.com/\">browsed the online shop Fashion Nova?</a></span> This e-commerce store placed its search bar tool at the very top of their page and it resulted in a <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a class=\"ci ce ks kt ku kv\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.instantsearchplus.com/optimize-ecommerce-site-search-box-three-easy-steps/\">40 percent increased conversion rate</a>.</span></p>\n<p data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1155 size-full\" src=\"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/static.fetchr.us/stage/1_U1XJRgVCUMppHp09pwQV5A.png\" alt=\"fashion nova website banner\" width=\"560\" height=\"75\" /></p>\n<h6><strong>Source: <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.fashionnova.com/\">Fashion Nova search stands out by letting users sort by sale items or new items, among other filters</a></span></strong></h6>\n<p id=\"1cdd\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a class=\"ci ce ks kt ku kv\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/ecommerce-website-search/\">By focusing on the search bar</a> </span>(like Footsmart, which includes a sophisticated and useful search function), using intelligent autocomplete in your search tool, and incorporating smarter breadcrumbs into your site can boost your functionality!</p>\n<h4 id=\"7385\" class=\"ka kb bm bc bb fy kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km\">Loading Times</h4>\n<p id=\"8395\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp kn jr ko jt kp jv kq jx kr jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Your site’s loading times matter so much more than you might think. The longer the loading time, the bigger the bounce rate — in other words, if your website takes forever to load, you’ll be bouncing away potential customers left and rate.</p>\n<p id=\"c19a\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Even the <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a class=\"ci ce ks kt ku kv\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://unbounce.com/landing-pages/7-page-speed-stats-for-marketers/\">slightest delay, like a 100-millisecond, in load time can cause your conversion rates to drop by 7 percent</a>.</span></p>\n<p id=\"04c9\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Further, and more in line with the point we made earlier about mobile, according to Unbounce, about <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a class=\"ci ce ks kt ku kv\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://unbounce.com/landing-pages/7-page-speed-stats-for-marketers/\">46 percent of people say</a> </span>that waiting for pages to load is what the dislike most about browsing the web on mobile.

But more than that, they’re visiting your site for the experience, and when it comes to experience, aesthetics and images matter.</p>\n<p id=\"be32\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><a class=\"ci ce ks kt ku kv\" href=\"https://www.shopify.com/guides/product-photography/importance\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Studies show that store visitors are primarily and predominantly engaged</span>  </a>by visual elements. The better those elements, the more inclined they are to stick around and explore your site. Think of the images on your site as a handshake — they’re your first impression.

An online shopper can’t physically pick up an object, get a feel for it, and make ad decision. The photo is all they have. Think about your photos on your site — are they good enough to make that sale?</p>\n<h4 id=\"a196\" class=\"ka kb bm bc bb fy kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km\">Fast Guest Check-Out Options</h4>\n<p id=\"6b45\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp kn jr ko jt kp jv kq jx kr jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Consumers tend to shy away from e-commerce shops that have lengthy, detailed, and annoying check out processes. Think about it — that’s essentially like waiting in line, right? Which is likely one of the reasons your potential client is shopping online to begin with.</p>\n<p id=\"8a5e\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The easiest ways to speed up the check-out process are by offering Google autofill forms, not requiring registration before purchasing, and avoiding frivolity, like asking for a second street address.</p>\n<p id=\"0426\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The features we mentioned above should help you on your journey toward preparing your online shop!
