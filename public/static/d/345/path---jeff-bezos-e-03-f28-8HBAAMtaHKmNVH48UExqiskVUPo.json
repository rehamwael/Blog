That gut feeling — and statistic — is what eventually led to his pioneering of Amazon.

He built it. Learning from the major lessons and tips of other successful entrepreneurs can only help you with your entrepreneurial dreams, too. With patience, listening, and the ability to learn, your e-commerce brand has endless potential.</mark></p>\n<p id=\"deb0\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Here are a few of the valuable lessons you can learn from Jeff Bezos.</p>\n<h5 id=\"44d5\" class=\"ka kb bm bc bb fy kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km\">Focus on Customers, Not Competitors</h5>\n<p id=\"89fe\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp kn jr ko jt kp jv kq jx kr jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">This might sound kind of iffy at first, but hear us out — rather, hear Jeff Bezos out.</p>\n<p id=\"379c\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">You might think your business is all about beating out your competitors. But it’s not. Ask yourself, <em class=\"lr\">at your business’ core, why does it exist?</em></p>\n<p id=\"c231\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><mark class=\"tc tb pj\">For the customers, right?</mark></p>\n<p id=\"e637\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><mark class=\"tc tb pj\">Jeff Bezos advises e-commerce entrepreneurs to get absolutely obsessed with the needs of your customers. He says we should</mark><mark class=\"tc tb pj\"><a class=\"ci ce ks kt ku kv\" href=\"https://blog.taskque.com/lessons-jeff-bezos/\"> <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">stop wasting our time on our competitors</span> — </a></mark><mark class=\"tc tb pj\">become customer-centric and that’s where you’ll find success.</mark></p>\n<p id=\"85c5\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">It’s so easy for us to consistently snoop out what our competitors are doing to see if we have the edge, but what does the edge matter if we’re entirely ignoring our customers? That’s the real goal. That’s how Amazon became so successful, too. Do you know of any real, viable Amazon competitors? Neither do we. That happened because Jeff Bezos focused specifically on serving customers — not by consistently looking over his shoulder at perceived competition.</p>\n<h5 id=\"5495\" class=\"ka kb bm bc bb fy kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km\">Be Stubborn but Flexible</h5>\n<p id=\"e180\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp kn jr ko jt kp jv kq jx kr jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">You probably already know that running your own e-commerce business requires a bit of stubbornness, but were you aware of how much? Bezos often says that you have to be absolutely stubborn about your own vision in order for it to succeed. That means being misunderstood more often than not in order to innovate.</p>\n<p id=\"180b\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><mark class=\"tc tb pj\">That being said,</mark><mark class=\"tc tb pj\"><a class=\"ci ce ks kt ku kv\" href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2011/09/09/jeff-bezos-long-term-amazon/\"> <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">you can’t be too stubborn on the details.</span></a></mark><mark class=\"tc tb pj\"> Sure, be entirely stubborn about your vision, but don’t forget to be flexible on the details that get you there — the key is finding the right balance of both!</mark></p>\n<h5 id=\"a91c\" class=\"ka kb bm bc bb fy kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km\">Never Stop Experimenting</h5>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1162 size-full\" src=\"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/static.fetchr.us/stage/Jeff-2.jpeg\" alt=\"Quote from Jeff Bezos\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" /></p>\n<p id=\"2739\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Even if Jeff Bezos wasn’t the one who said that, it would make sense, right? So long as you’re putting in double the work, you’re getting double the inventiveness. This sentiment absolutely applies to e-commerce startups.</p>\n<p id=\"b3d9\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">How?</p>\n<p id=\"4503\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Think about it. You’re consistently experimenting with what works best for you, what works for your customers, how to balance their needs with your expenses, how to better serve your clientele while sticking true to your vision — that’s a lot of spinning plates and a lot of constant experimentation.</p>\n<p id=\"29e5\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a class=\"ci ce ks kt ku kv\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/lessons-from-jeff-bezos/\">This type of mindset isn’t just specific to Jeff Bezos, though</a> </span>— a lot of successful people and companies have adopted this mindset. Consider how large MNCs across the world are now placing huge stress on innovation and experimentation (think IBM with Innovation Center and Google with Google Labs).</p>\n<p id=\"2ab9\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Long story short, if you resign your business and your practice to remain static, that’s exactly the type of business you’ll have — a static one. Experimentation and innovation allow your business to thrive and become more dynamic.</p>\n<h5 id=\"59a8\" class=\"ka kb bm bc bb fy kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km\">Think in the Long Term</h5>\n<p id=\"eaa2\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp kn jr ko jt kp jv kq jx kr jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a class=\"ci ce ks kt ku kv\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://gigaom.com/2009/06/15/tips-on-innovation-enterprenuership-from-jeff-bezos/\">When Jeff Bezos is asked about the results of his quarterly numbers, he replies that he simply doesn’t know them.</a></span></p>\n<p id=\"5a81\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><mark class=\"tc tb pj\">Why? Because that’s too short-term. Why focus on the short-term when you can focus on the long-term? On the future? On how the decisions you make now will benefit your long-term business plans?</mark></p>\n<p id=\"2536\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Bezos often states that this mindset, though beneficial, takes conviction. A short-term approach may solve short-term problems, but in the end, you’re stuck dealing with the minutia of everyday decisions. Make deliberate decisions based on the long-term.</p>\n<h5 id=\"0194\" class=\"ka kb bm bc bb fy kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km\">Don’t Fear Change, Embrace It</h5>\n<p id=\"3e81\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp kn jr ko jt kp jv kq jx kr jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">You’re familiar with Amazon, so you know this to be true — embracing new trends has worked wonderfully for Amazon. Why? Because Bezos isn’t afraid of change. He embraces it.</p>\n<p id=\"fd37\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><mark class=\"tc tb pj\"><a class=\"ci ce ks kt ku kv\" href=\"https://www.inc.com/melissa-chu/jeff-bezos-makes-life-changing-decisions-using-this-strategy.html\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">A lot of companies who stay up-to-date on</span></a></mark><mark class=\"tc tb pj\"> trends and ride the fad waves are more likely to succeed, better serve customers, and stay ahead of the game, too.</mark></p>\n<p id=\"fb96\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">As an entrepreneur yourself, don’t be afraid to embrace change — brace for it, instead.</p>\n<h5 id=\"532b\" class=\"ka kb bm bc bb fy kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km\">Never Lose Your Startup Mindset</h5>\n<p id=\"4525\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp kn jr ko jt kp jv kq jx kr jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Your Day-1 attitude is everything — at least, according to Jeff Bezos.</p>\n<p id=\"9a06\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">In other words, the startup mindset you ride in on at the very beginning of your entrepreneurial e-commerce career is going to be the attitude that keeps you in the game.</p>\n<p id=\"811c\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Why? Because you care. You’re there to make a difference. You’re there to be stubborn and prove you can do anything.</p>\n<p id=\"e6d6\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Losing that startup fire can be incredibly damaging for entrepreneurs. A company, or individual, who’s deciding every single day to come at the business with that “day 1 mindset” is deciding to experiment, innovate, invent, obsess, and create.</p>\n<p id=\"fcda\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><mark class=\"tc tb pj\">As an aspiring e-commerce player in a major, driving market, it’s vital to pay attention to those who have succeeded before you — especially those who have succeeded to the degree of Jeff Bezos.</mark> It makes sense, doesn’t it? If the CEO and founder of the world’s largest firm has something to say that you could learn from, wouldn’t you want to listen?
