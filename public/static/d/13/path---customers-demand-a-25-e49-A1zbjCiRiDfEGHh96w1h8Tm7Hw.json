In other words, in an Amazon-style world, your e-commerce customers undoubtedly expect shipping that meets <strong class=\"jo lc\">their </strong>deadlines. Further, these deadlines — these needs your customers have — are changing and advancing every day.</p>\n<p id=\"21d3\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Undoubtedly, it can be hard to keep up. That being said, if you want to satisfy customers, meet shipping demands, and — of course — stay one step ahead of your competition, there’s huge value in continuously learning and re-learning the ever-changing logistics of last-mile delivery demands.</p>\n<p id=\"926d\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">One of the best ways to do all of those things is to consistently understand your user and consumer expectations.</p>\n<p id=\"fd6c\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp jq jr js jt ju jv jw jx jy jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Here are a few of those current factors to be familiar with!</p>\n<h4 id=\"ecda\" class=\"ka kb bm bc bb fy kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km\">Faster Fulfillment</h4>\n<p id=\"198b\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp kn jr ko jt kp jv kq jx kr jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Here’s the reality — customers want their products as fast as possible. That means e-commerce shop owners such as yourself must figure out the fastest fulfillment times possible. This need for faster fulfillment starts with you but ends with your shipping company, meaning every single point of the fulfillment process requires faster speeds. And,<a class=\"ci ce ks kt ku kv\" href=\"https://cerasis.com/last-mile/\"> <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">according to Cerasis</span></a>, this is an ever-evolving and ever-changing process — shipments that used to require one hour to process are being forced into nearly three-minute intervals. And that won’t last long either. This fulfillment process constantly is being forced to speed up to satisfy customer&#8217;s demand.</p>\n<h4 id=\"6027\" class=\"ka kb bm bc bb fy kc kd ke kf kg kh ki kj kk kl km\">Speed</h4>\n<p id=\"22a7\" class=\"jm jn bm bc jo b jp kn jr ko jt kp jv kq jx kr jz\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Remember that need for faster fulfillment? The need for speed is relevant, too.  Now, though, companies increasingly are offering same-day delivery — not only does this push the company offering this bonus to spin their wheels even harder to keep up with their customer demands, but it also is forcing other companies to compete and attempt to keep up the pace.</p>\n<figure class=\"iw ix iy iz ja eq v w paragraph-image\">\n<div class=\"v w uc\">\n<div class=\"jf l dh jg\">\n<div class=\"ud l\">\n<div class=\"dq jc dj n o jd x ip t je\"><img class=\"wp-image-1167 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/static.fetchr.us/stage/pic-1.png\" alt=\"Mckinsey Delivery Model Graph\" width=\"300\" height=\"155\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<h6><strong>Source:<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://cerasis.com/last-mile/\"> McKinsey &amp; Company</a></span></strong></h6>\n<p id=\"7162\" class=\"hk hl cf bd hm b hn of hp og oh oi oj ok ol om hx\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Which makes sense, right?

It’s the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) smart technology that’s able to track shipments in real time — providing customers with a real-time report of where their items are, what delays they might face, and when they’ll be arriving. In fact, even SMS and Google notifications now are pushed out to customers so they can be kept consistently in the loop regarding the location and status of their deliverables.</p>\n<p id=\"c572\" class=\"hk hl cf bd hm b hn of hp og oh oi oj ok ol om hx\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">This use of smart technology — which, as would be expected in an ever-evolving, technological society — truly is driving the way that last-mile delivery is growing and affecting how last-mile delivery services (such as Fetchr!) are operating.</p>\n<h4 id=\"ded8\" class=\"gj gk cf bd bc ds on oo op oq or os ot ou ov ow gn\">Growth of Robotic Delivery</h4>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1168 size-full\" src=\"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/static.fetchr.us/stage/robot-1.png\" alt=\"Robotic Delivery Solutions\" width=\"300\" height=\"227\" /></p>\n<h6><strong>Source: <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a class=\"bk cv pc pd pe pf\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://weburbanist.com/2015/11/19/robotic-delivery-6-wheeled-drones-set-to-roll-out-in-london/\">Weburbanist</a></span></strong></h6>\n<p id=\"1cad\" class=\"hk hl cf bd hm b hn of hp og oh oi oj ok ol om hx\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">As we continue to evolve technologically, the proliferation of robotic delivery will be a huge factor in determining the way last-mile delivery companies proceed.
