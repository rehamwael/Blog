As our modern-day society continues to grow and offers us the technology to solve our delivery issues, we must first emphasize understanding and studying the issues so we can properly utilize that technology.</p>\n<p id=\"b272\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu pd hw pe pf pg ph pi pj pk ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">We’ve listed out the top five last mile challenges that delivery companies face. But more than that, we’ve included a few creative solutions and suggestions for solving these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"ea4e\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu pd hw pe pf pg ph pi pj pk ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Check out the top five last mile problems — and their solutions — below!</p>\n<h4 id=\"18e5\" class=\"gq gr cf bd bc ds ud ue uf ug uh ui uj uk ul um gu\">Challenge No 1: Incomplete Delivery</h4>\n<p id=\"62f0\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu qb hw qc pf qd ph qe pj qf ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Incomplete deliveries area common problem for last mile delivery services. Whether this means that the courier was given the wrong address, there was a snag in traffic, or an unforeseen circumstance, the general idea behind an incomplete delivery is that the parcel simply didn’t make it to its final destination.</p>\n<figure class=\"or os ot ou ov gm n o paragraph-image\">\n<div class=\"n o xf\">\n<div class=\"en s gn go\">\n<div class=\"xg s\">\n<div class=\"lr ox t u v fn p fw li oy\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1150 size-full\" src=\"https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/static.fetchr.us/stage/1_9S2c4i12KnLTzyv04eEhvQ.png\" alt=\"delivery route\" width=\"300\" height=\"182\" /></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><figcaption class=\"bh fv xh dl ku q n o xi xj bc fu\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><strong class=\"ht if\"> </strong></figcaption></figure>\n<h5><strong>Solution</strong></h5>\n<p id=\"034a\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu pd hw pe pf pg ph pi pj pk ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">While there are infinite possibilities for unforeseen circumstances that could disrupt a last mile delivery, planning ahead can work wonders for last mile delivery services. Consider using a route planning software to help you strategize and plan ahead so that you can avoid incomplete deliveries.<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"> <a class=\"bk cv pl pm pn po\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://metrobi.com/route-optimization/how-to-improve-delivery-efficiency-with-route-planning-software/\">According to Metrobi</a></span>, by implementing route planning software, companies that use route optimization software have a 65 percent higher customer satisfaction rate. The greatest things about these types of software? They’re customizable and adaptable, changing your route plan based on order cancellations, weather, traffic conditions, and more.</p>\n<h4 id=\"c510\" class=\"gq gr cf bd bc ds ud ue uf ug uh ui uj uk ul um gu\">Challenge No 2: Late Delivery</h4>\n<p id=\"6b4d\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu qb hw qc pf qd ph qe pj qf ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Late deliveries are another common problem for last mile delivery services. Any number of things could create a delay and interrupt your schedule, but the reality is, even if the delay isn’t directly your fault, it could result in an irritated customer.</p>\n<p id=\"1686\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu pd hw pe pf pg ph pi pj pk ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">In our fast-paced world, customers expect same-day delivery or next-day delivery — this is a much more commonly accepted frame of time for deliveries. Interrupting that expectation tends to result in an irate customer.</p>\n<h5 id=\"1fa9\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu pd hw pe pf pg ph pi pj pk ie\"><strong class=\"ht if\">Solution</strong></h5>\n<p id=\"06c5\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu pd hw pe pf pg ph pi pj pk ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Transparency and communication are the keys to ensuring your customers are continually satisfied. The reality of the situation is that delays happen — while some are avoidable, there are times where you can’t do a thing to solve them. Allowing them the ability to track the order (and offering honest communication about their deliveries, which will be mentioned in the next section) can keep them calm and rationale. <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a class=\"bk cv pl pm pn po\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.valuewalk.com/2018/10/last-mile-delivery-explained/\">Another way to solve this issue is to stick with the route planning method — this helps avoid (most types of) delays and complications</a>.</span></p>\n<h4 id=\"ca25\" class=\"gq gr cf bd bc ds ud ue uf ug uh ui uj uk ul um gu\">Challenge No 3: Transparency</h4>\n<p id=\"7982\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu qb hw qc pf qd ph qe pj qf ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The very basics of customer service within the delivery industry are simple — you have a customer who orders a package and expects it by a certain time; you, as the delivery company handling the last mile delivery are expected to deliver that package on time. Obviously, this doesn’t always happen — there are delays, unexpected circumstances, and more that could disrupt that timeline. But what customers really want — more than anything — is their courier services to be transparent. They want the ability to track their packages and updates in real time. This is not always something courier companies offer.</p>\n<h5 id=\"d589\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu pd hw pe pf pg ph pi pj pk ie\"><strong class=\"ht if\">Solution</strong></h5>\n<p id=\"9e46\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu pd hw pe pf pg ph pi pj pk ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">The easiest way to solve this issue, theoretically,<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"> <a class=\"bk cv pl pm pn po\" style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://www.valuewalk.com/2018/10/last-mile-delivery-explained/\">is to provide customers with real-time, GPS tracking options</a></span> that allow full transparency and disclosure about where their packages <em class=\"qn\">actually </em>are and when they can expect them. Another interesting solution? Allowing customers the option to have 100 percent control on choosing their preferred delivery date and time to avoid complications with handing off packages.</p>\n<h4 id=\"bc9d\" class=\"gq gr cf bd bc ds ud ue uf ug uh ui uj uk ul um gu\">Challenge No 4: Shipping Cost</h4>\n<p id=\"2647\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu qb hw qc pf qd ph qe pj qf ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">In an ideal world, retailers would find a delivery service that’s both fast and affordable — but that’s not always the case. Typically, businesses (especially e-commerce companies) are pressured to compete with bigger companies (<a class=\"bk cv pl pm pn po\" href=\"https://www.valuewalk.com/2018/10/last-mile-delivery-explained/\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">who have more money to spend on delivery services</span>).</a> In other words, most retailers can’t offer low shipping costs <strong class=\"ht if\"><em class=\"qn\">and </em></strong>fast delivery service, which often is reflected in their shipping costs (as a note, unexpected shipping cost are the no. 1 reason people choose to exit a website with items in their cart).</p>\n<h5 id=\"7945\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu pd hw pe pf pg ph pi pj pk ie\"><strong class=\"ht if\">Solution</strong></h5>\n<p id=\"4234\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu pd hw pe pf pg ph pi pj pk ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">A possible solution for shipping costs could be to partner with a courier service and include their shipping costs in your item prices. That way, you’re offering a fixed price to your customers with a built-in shipping rate included.</p>\n<h4 id=\"d1b9\" class=\"gq gr cf bd bc ds ud ue uf ug uh ui uj uk ul um gu\">Challenge No 5: Dishonest Customers</h4>\n<p id=\"e1b5\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu qb hw qc pf qd ph qe pj qf ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">We’ve all dealt with dishonest customers before. You know the type — they might claim they didn’t receive goods, that their shipment was delayed, or that their packages never arrived. While an unsatisfied (though dishonest) customers is never a good thing, these types of customers create a bigger issue — they have the ability to take to the internet and give your company a poor review.</p>\n<h5 id=\"6fce\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu pd hw pe pf pg ph pi pj pk ie\"><strong class=\"ht if\">Solution</strong></h5>\n<p id=\"538e\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu pd hw pe pf pg ph pi pj pk ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">One of the simplest ways to solve this issue is to require a customer to sign for a package, confirming both that they received it and<strong class=\"ht if\"> </strong>that it was in excellent condition.</p>\n<p id=\"d030\" class=\"hr hs cf bd ht b hu pd hw pe pf pg ph pi pj pk ie\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><a class=\"bk cv pl pm pn po\" href=\"https://fetchr.us/about-us/\"><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">As an international courier,</span></a> we’re frequently tackling the last mile delivery issues that occur all over the world — particularly the <em class=\"qn\">no street address issue </em>(a disruptor in the industry that has been prevalent for decades).
