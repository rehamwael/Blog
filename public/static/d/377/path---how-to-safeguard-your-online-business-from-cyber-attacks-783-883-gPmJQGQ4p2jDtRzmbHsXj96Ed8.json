Even further, it’s estimated that cyber criminals will steal an estimated 33 billion records in 2023 — a pretty crazy estimation, right?</p>\n<p id=\"6fa1\" class=\"hz ia cn bd ib b ic na ie nb nc nd ne nf ng nh im\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">While those numbers are daunting for everyone, they are even more daunting for entrepreneurs who run their businesses primarily online. That’s right, entrepreneurs such as you.</p>\n<p id=\"7b75\" class=\"hz ia cn bd ib b ic na ie nb nc nd ne nf ng nh im\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">As an e-commerce entrepreneur, you probably already know that cyber attacks can’t be taken lightly. But even with this knowledge, ask yourself, ‘Are you doing everything you can to ensure the safety of your online business?’</p>\n<p id=\"5276\" class=\"hz ia cn bd ib b ic na ie nb nc nd ne nf ng nh im\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">If the answer is no, don’t panic. While it’s crucial you get your cybersecurity straightened out right away, there’s no need to feel overwhelmed. We’ve compiled some helpful cybersecurity advice that we believe can help get you — and your business — get on the right track for better online security.</p>\n<p id=\"5fd4\" class=\"hz ia cn bd ib b ic na ie nb nc nd ne nf ng nh im\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Check it out here!</p>\n<h4 id=\"226e\" class=\"gt gu cn bd bc ea ue uf ug uh ui uj uk ul um un gx\">Secure Your Hardware + Software</h4>\n<p id=\"5791\" class=\"hz ia cn bd ib b ic uo ie up nc uq ne ur ng us im\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">This is the biggest piece of the cybersecurity puzzle, which means this should come first. Always, always secure your hardware and software. First and foremost, protect your assets with complicated passwords that only a device user has access to. We suggest MFA password systems, which we’ll discuss a little bit later in this article. It’s also vital that you install anti-virus software to help keep the bad guys out as well as installing a firewall, too.</p>\n<h4 id=\"6ab9\" class=\"gt gu cn bd bc ea ue uf ug uh ui uj uk ul um un gx\">Encrypt Your Data</h4>\n<p id=\"5e13\" class=\"hz ia cn bd ib b ic uo ie up nc uq ne ur ng us im\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">To truly protect your business from cyber crime, you need to take it a step further than just preventing physical access. You need to ensure that your data, if accessed, is rendered entirely useless if it should so happen to fall into the wrong hands. The answer here?<a class=\"bk dd nq nr ns nt\" href=\"https://www.privacyend.com/protect-your-business-from-cyber-attacks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong class=\"ib in\">Encrypting your data</strong></span></a><strong class=\"ib in\">.</strong></p>\n<p id=\"6a09\" class=\"hz ia cn bd ib b ic na ie nb nc nd ne nf ng nh im\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">All the sensitive data you have — customer information, employee records, business data, and more — should be carefully encrypted so that even if someone can access your records, they’ll have no way of viewing them.</p>\n<h4 id=\"2e78\" class=\"gt gu cn bd bc ea ue uf ug uh ui uj uk ul um un gx\">Consistently Back Up Your Information to Multiple Safe Locations</h4>\n<p id=\"6ccc\" class=\"hz ia cn bd ib b ic uo ie up nc uq ne ur ng us im\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Investing in securing your hardware and software is a great start. Further, encrypting your data is excellent, too. But you have to take it a step further to truly protect your information. You have to consistently back up your information to multiple safe locations.</p>\n<p id=\"c076\" class=\"hz ia cn bd ib b ic na ie nb nc nd ne nf ng nh im\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Imagine a situation where a cyber criminal breaks past your barriers and steals all of your data, files, and information. Tthat’s awful, right? What could be worse? We’ll tell you — having no back-up for any of that vital information.</p>\n<p id=\"da3b\" class=\"hz ia cn bd ib b ic na ie nb nc nd ne nf ng nh im\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><a class=\"bk dd nq nr ns nt\" href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/316886\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong class=\"ib in\">Back up your data consistently and store it separately from your main system.</strong></a> That way, even on the off-chance that someone does breach your system, you won’t have lost your data forever.</p>\n<h4 id=\"2822\" class=\"gt gu cn bd bc ea ue uf ug uh ui uj uk ul um un gx\">Seek Out Experts for Advice</h4>\n<p id=\"8eb2\" class=\"hz ia cn bd ib b ic uo ie up nc uq ne ur ng us im\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">We know what you’re probably thinking. You’re likely thinking that hiring a professional is going to cost money, and money (especially if you’re a small business owner) can be a tough thing to dole out. But here’s the deal — you run an online business. Think about the amount of money you’d be losing if a cyber criminal did hack your system, steal your data, and shut down your store. Not only would you lose business until you get your shop back up, but you’d also likely lose customers. Who wants to do business with someone who’s going to lose their information? In this case, spending a little money is absolutely crucial. Work with an expert to best protect and secure your online shop and data.</p>\n<h4 id=\"6400\" class=\"gt gu cn bd bc ea ue uf ug uh ui uj uk ul um un gx\">Don’t Forget Cybersecurity Insurance</h4>\n<p id=\"ebc0\" class=\"hz ia cn bd ib b ic uo ie up nc uq ne ur ng us im\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">You might think this is overkill, but with the way cyber attacks continues to develop, having this type<a class=\"bk dd nq nr ns nt\" href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/316886\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <strong class=\"ib in\">of insurance is much more necessary than you <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">might</span> think</strong>.</a> In 2017, the global average cost of a single data breach was estimated at about $3.6 million USD. The losses that can occur because of these crimes are only truly mitigated when a company invests in cybersecurity insurance.</p>\n<h4 id=\"7d06\" class=\"gt gu cn bd bc ea ue uf ug uh ui uj uk ul um un gx\">Invest in MFA Systems</h4>\n<p id=\"56f0\" class=\"hz ia cn bd ib b ic uo ie up nc uq ne ur ng us im\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Stop relying on a single password to protect your most valuable information. It’s time to launch into the future and create a multi-factor authentication system for your data. Why? Because by using several required factors, you’re better able to authenticate a user before they’re granted access to your files, data, records, and more. That means if a hacker does manage to phish past your first password, they have another authentication to hack through too. It’s a much harder, more time-consuming process. <a class=\"bk dd nq nr ns nt\" href=\"https://www.ybs.us/2019/05/what-is-multi-factor-authentication/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong class=\"ib in\">Check out even more information here about MFA and how it can help your business.</strong></a></p>\n<h4 id=\"8f1e\" class=\"gt gu cn bd bc ea ue uf ug uh ui uj uk ul um un gx\">Create an Emergency Plan</h4>\n<p id=\"a5e3\" class=\"hz ia cn bd ib b ic uo ie up nc uq ne ur ng us im\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">Remember that professional we talked about hiring? Bring them back into the mix. Discuss an emergency plan that you can implement to ensure that, even on the off-chance a cyber crime does occur, you’re able to get the show back on the road quickly and efficiently.</p>\n<p id=\"d397\" class=\"hz ia cn bd ib b ic na ie nb nc nd ne nf ng nh im\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\">As an e-commerce business, your cyber safety is incredibly important. Because your entire business is based online, it’s vital that you’re taking extra precautions to protect your business, your brand, your assets and, of course, your customers’ information. When it comes down to it, there’s nothing more important than your cybersecurity. Ensure you’ve always got a plan in place to fight again cyber attacks and to protect and secure your online business.</p>\n</div>\n</section>\n<hr class=\"nu gd kt ce nv lb nw nx ny nz oa\" />\n<section class=\"go gp gq gr gs\">\n<div class=\"r lz p q l m\">\n<p id=\"3fde\" class=\"hz ia cn bd ib b ic na ie nb nc nd ne nf ng nh im\" data-selectable-paragraph=\"\"><em class=\"ob\">We are Fetchr; a company specialized in e-fulfillment.
